# PreviousWork
This is the doctoral thesis I have produced using Stata, Qualtrics, and Excel, as part of the requirements for a doctoral degree in political science at the University of Toronto.

In terms of modelling, I develop logistic regression models, generalized ordered logit models, and partial proportional odds models to predict participation in organizations and networks as well as identification with spatio-territorial entities on four levels.
