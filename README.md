# Summary
This is the doctoral thesis I have produced using Stata, Qualtrics, and Excel, as part of the requirements for a doctoral degree in political science at the University of Toronto.

The datasets are original and come from two surveys I have designed and conducted in 2017. 

Individuals were contacted through the use of the community organizations' network (e.g. an email invitation was sent by the organization to their members/followers/sympathizers) or through a simple publication on a Facebook group affiliated with or identifying with Quebec’s English-speaking communities and Franco-Ontarian communities. A hyperlink was provided to each participant so as to ensure that they were fully informed of the study’s configuration and implications. 

For the Anglo-Quebecer sample, a total of 12 organizations and Facebook groups were involved in the study 305 respondents anonymously filled out the online survey questionnaire. The researcher is very thankful to all who participated and/or allowed him to send an invitation to members/followers/sympathizers using an organization’s network.

For the Franco-Ontarian sample, a total of 10 organizations and Facebook groups were involved in the study and 249 respondents anonymously filled out the online survey questionnaire. The researcher is very thankful to all who participated and/or allowed him to send an invitation to members/followers/sympathizers using an organization’s network.

Each participant was granted a chance to win a $100 cash prize as compensation. The cash prize was then awarded to one randomly selected participant across the two samples.

In terms of modelling, I develop logistic regression models, generalized ordered logit models, and partial proportional odds models to predict participation in organizations and networks as well as identification with spatio-territorial entities on four levels (municipal, provincial, federal, and global).
